The platform's Content Score correlates 26% with Google rankings—significantly higher than competitors like Frase at barely 0.1% correlation.

## FAQ

**Can AI writing tools actually produce content that ranks on Google?**

Yes, when used properly. Tools like Koala AI, Surfer SEO, and Frase analyze top-ranking pages and incorporate semantic keywords, entities, and structure that search engines favor. However, AI-generated content requires human editing to add expertise, authenticity, and nuance that algorithms can't replicate. The best approach treats AI as a research and drafting assistant that handles time-consuming tasks, letting you focus on strategic thinking and refinement that differentiates your content from competitors.

**Which AI content writing tool offers the best value for small businesses?**

Rytr provides exceptional value with a free plan offering 10,000 characters monthly and paid plans starting at just $9/month. ChatGPT's free version delivers powerful capabilities without any cost. For SEO-specific needs, Frase offers comprehensive optimization at $38.25/month—significantly cheaper than alternatives. The best choice depends on whether you prioritize general writing assistance, SEO optimization, or specific content types like sales copy or social media posts.

**How do I prevent AI-generated content from sounding generic?**

Inject personal experience, specific examples, and unique perspectives during editing. Use AI for structure and first drafts, then add stories, case studies, and insights only you can provide. Customize tone settings to match your brand voice and specify target audiences clearly in prompts. Tools with brand voice training like StoryChief and Jasper learn your style over time, producing increasingly authentic results. Always edit AI outputs to remove repetitive phrasing and add conversational elements that create connection with readers.
